In the era of the web being dominated by mobile devices, the development community still strugles on delivering good experiences for slow mobile devices with unreliable 3g connections and lack of RAM memory. Frameworks focusing on a JavaScript first approach, like SPAs (Single Page Application) have difficulties on providing fast load times to these devices due to the great amount of initial bundle sizes (JS) required for rendering a website. 

Deco addresses the modern, mobile first, web by relying as little as possible on JavaScript running on the browser, making websites feel way more responsive even on modest hardware. Removing unecessary JavaScript, alongside other optimizations, allow developers to create amazing digital experiences. In this article you will learn how deco's rendering pipeline works and how you can take advantage of it to design and build performatic websites.
